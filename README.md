# lua-sandbox
Something for developers to test and play around with the Roblox Studio script engine without really using Studio itself.

Mainly for education purposes and practicing code for myself.

Designed to see errors and what not, make sure to use https://whatsapython.github.io/lua-sandbox/ if you want to test it out yourself.
